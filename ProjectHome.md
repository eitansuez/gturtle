A simple 2D implementation of [turtle graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) (similar to [kturtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTurtle)) implemented in the groovy programming language.

A swing application, a groovy dsl, with the basic/expected commands:
> fd (forward), bk (back), lt (left), and rt (right)

See samples/ directory for various samples (essentially taken from the book ['turtle geometry'](http://books.google.com/books?id=3geYp44hJVcC) by Abelson and diSessa).
