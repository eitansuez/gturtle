Turtle Geometry

Enhancements:
  - Add ability to set runspeed (animate drawing)
  - Provide a way to stop / interrupt the evaluation thread from the GUI

  - Editor view should have a status bar with editor caret position information
  - Mouseover turtlegraphics area should display coordinates (as tooltip?)

  - Try out jEdit's TextArea in place of JSyntaxPane (perhaps also jEdit's file chooser?)
  - Idea:  implement GTurtle as a jEdit plugin

  - Example:  instead of exposing commands setpencolor/showpencolor, expose the property
     "pencolor".  then can just say "pencolor = red" or "println pencolor"

Issues:
  - println's don't work or don't work reliably
  - each editor should have its own shell / context
  - Program sometimes stops responding.  Guessing that GroovyShell might need to be replaced perhaps after an exception takes place.
