Turtle Geometry

Enhancements:

  - Implement wrapping

  - Mouseover turtlegraphics area should display coordinates
  - Editor view should have a status bar with editor caret position information

  - Multiple editors (tabbed pane)

  - Ability to name and hatch turtles
  - Add ability to set runspeed (animate)
  - Add ability to drag a turtle to another position (calls setpos)

  - Add "Recent documents" submenu or items
  - Replace the kturtle icon with a unique one

  - Example:  instead of exposing commands setpencolor/showpencolor, expose the property
     "pencolor".  then can just say "pencolor = red" or "println pencolor"
