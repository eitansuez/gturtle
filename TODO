Turtle Geometry

Enhancements:
  - Add ability to set runspeed (animate drawing)
  - Provide a way to stop / interrupt the evaluation thread from the GUI

  - Editor view should have a status bar with editor caret position information
  - Mouseover turtlegraphics area should display coordinates (as tooltip?)

  - Try out jEdit's TextArea in place of JSyntaxPane (perhaps also jEdit's file chooser?)
  - Idea:  implement GTurtle as a jEdit plugin

  - Example:  instead of exposing commands setpencolor/showpencolor, expose the property
     "pencolor".  then can just say "pencolor = red" or "println pencolor"
  - Also: setup shell/script such that can do "new Turtle()" instead of binding a function to
     do it on behalf of the script.

Issues:
  - println's don't work or don't work reliably
  - should each editor have its own shell / context ?
