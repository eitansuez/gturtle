Turtle Geometry

Issues:
  - println's don't work or don't work reliably
  - each editor should have its own shell / context
  - Program sometimes stops responding.  Guessing that GroovyShell might need to be replaced
     perhaps after an exception takes place.
  - Provide a way to stop / interrupt the evaluation thread from the GUI

Enhancements:
  - Add ability to drag a turtle to another position (calls setpos)

  - Don't like jsyntaxpane editor.  Use jEdit's.
  - Ditto for the file chooser: user jEdit's.
  - Idea:  why not implement GTurtle as a jEdit plugin?

  - Add ability to set runspeed (animate drawing)

  - Mouseover turtlegraphics area should display coordinates
  - Editor view should have a status bar with editor caret position information

  - Ability to name and hatch turtles

  - Add "Recent documents" submenu or items
  - Replace the kturtle icon with a unique one

  - Example:  instead of exposing commands setpencolor/showpencolor, expose the property
     "pencolor".  then can just say "pencolor = red" or "println pencolor"
